            <h2>Basketball legacy</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of our game" by NBA commissioner Adam
                    Silver, and The New York Times wrote that he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history of
                    the sport." Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation", while both Sporting News
                    and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s. In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked
                    him the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players including Kevin Durant, Dirk
                    Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan. The
                    Press-Enterprise described Bryant as "maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history". He was
                    the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history.
                    Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017.</p>
                <p>With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, he was
                    considered one of the most complete players in NBA history. He was the first player in NBA history to
                    have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists, and was one of only four players with
                    25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists. Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and
                    2006–07 seasons. His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history,
                    behind only Chamberlain's 100. He scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in
                    league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118); six times Bryant scored at least 60. He was
                    just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he accomplished
                    four times. Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first
                    seed in the Western Conference. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S.
                    men's basketball team, occasionally referred to as "The Redeem Team". He won another gold medal at the
                    2012 Summer Olympics. He led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals
                    MVP award on both occasions.</p>
                <p>Bryant was an 18-time All-Star, which ranks second behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 19. He was chosen a
                    record 18 straight times, each time as a starter. On four occasions (2003, 2011, 2013, 2016) he was the
                    leading vote-getter. Four times Bryant was named the All-Star MVP, a record he shares with Bob Pettit.
                    He was selected to the All-NBA Team on 15 occasions, tied for the most with Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan,
                    and his 11 first-team honors are tied for the second-most with Karl Malone. Bryant was also a 12-time
                    All-Defensive Team selection, trailing only Duncan's 15, and nine times he was named to the
                    All-Defensive First Team, tied with Jordan, Garnett, and Gary Payton for the most all time. He was the
                    first guard to play 20 seasons in the NBA.[374] He also won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 1997 and was
                    its youngest winner. In his career, Bryant scored 40-plus points in 121 games, and 21 times he recorded
                    a triple-double.</p>
                <p>Following his death on January 26, 2020, wherein LeBron James had a message about his death to promise
                    "to continue Bryant's legacy", on February 15, 2020, commissioner Adam Silver announced that the NBA
                    All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award in honor of
                    Bryant.</p>
                <p>During the 2020 NBA Playoffs, Lakers players wore the 'Black Mamba' jerseys in honor of Bryant. Designed
                    by Bryant himself, the black jersey features a snakeskin pattern with yellow accents and 16 stars
                    representing the team’s 16 championships. In Game 2 win against the Denver Nuggets in the Western
                    Conference finals, Anthony Davis made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer and yelled Bryant’s name, while wearing
                    the team was wearing the 'Black Mamba' jerseys. Following a Game 2 win in the 2020 NBA Finals, LeBron
                    James was asked about the jerseys and had this to say:<q>It’s always special to represent someone that
                        meant so much, not only to the game but also to the Lakers organization for 20-plus years. For us to
                        honor him, being on the floor, this is what it’s all about.</q>
